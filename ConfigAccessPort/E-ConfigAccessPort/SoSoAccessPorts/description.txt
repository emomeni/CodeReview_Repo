- we are going to issue the command "show interfaces switchport" on each switch
- then we will extract the interfaces that satisfy two conditions:
--- condition 1: the interface must be in static access mode
--- condition 2: the interface belongs to vlan 200
- and we finally going to apply some commands to those interafces.
- the configuration we are going to apply to each interface is obtained by rendering a jinja2 template.
